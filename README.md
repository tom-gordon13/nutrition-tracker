<h2> :question: What is SuperFood </h2>
<p>SuperFood is a full MERN-stack web application that allows users to track their nutrient intake on a daily basis. This app isn't about calorie-counting. It's about a holistic understanding of what specific nutrients you're getting enough of and, more importantly, which ones you're not!</p>
