<h2> :question: What is SuperFood </h2>
<p>SuperFood is a full MERN-stack web application that allows users to track their nutrient intake on a daily basis. This app isn't about calorie-counting. It's about a holistic understanding of what specific nutrients you're getting enough of and, more importantly, which ones you're not!</p>

<details>
<summary> The Basics</summary>

| About SuperFood |  |
|------------ | ------------|
| <h4 align='left'>As mentioned, SuperFood allows users to track their daily nutrition from a micro level.</h4> | <img src='public/rm_images/sf_1.png' width='1100'> |
| <h4 align='left'>SuperFood utilizes data from the US Department of Agriculture's FoodData Central database to calculate nutrient totals for a given food item.</h4> | <img src='public/rm_images/sf_2.png' width='1100'> |
</details>

<details>
<summary> Getting Started</summary>

| Signing In |  |
|------------ | ------------|
| <h4 align='left'>Setting up an account with SuperFood is super easy - just navigate to the home page and click 'Sign Up'! You'll be required to enter your name, email, and password. Don't worry, we won't send you spam emaiL!</h4> | <img src='public/rm_images/sf_3.png' width='1100'> |
| <h4 align='left'>Once you're signed in, you immediately have full access to the SuperFood app. If you need to sign out, don't worry! Your data will be stored securely, so you can log back in whenever its time to log your next meal!</h4> | <img src='public/rm_images/sf_4.png' width='1100'> |
</details>

<details>
<summary>Logging a Food Item</summary>

| Searching for an Item |  |
|------------ | ------------|
| <h4 align='left'>On the lefthand side, you can search for a specific food item that you ate. Filters below the search bar allow you to limit your search to only branded or only generic items. If you don't see what you're looking for in the first 3 items shown, try toggling through the search results to see if it pops up!</h4> |  <img src='public/rm_images/sf_5.png' width='550'>|
| <h4 align='left'>Once you find the item you ate, click and drag it to the box in the center of the screen. Make sure you've selected the correct date and meal for that given item first!</h4> |  <img src='public/rm_images/sf_6.png' width='550'>|

</details>

<details>
<summary> Nutrition Summary</summary>

| Track What You've Eaten  |  |
|------------ | ------------|
| <h4 align='left'>Once you start adding foods you've eaten, the panel on the righthand side will start populating with the nutrition information with all the foods you've eaten for that day (not just for the specific meal).</h4> |  <img src='public/rm_images/sf_7.png' width='550'>|
| <h4 align='left'>Feel free to scroll through previous days and compare what your nutrition summary looks like! Take note of some of the vitamins and nutrients you're getting a lot of, as well as the ones where you might be falling short!</h4> |  <img src='public/rm_images/sf_8.png' width='550'>|
